## I'm Vlad
I'm known as WolfNT90 and Fennecsxx, and I'm a very lazy kind of developer. Moreso a hobbyist programmer. I'm not used to uploading the things that I do, but in recent times I thought to myself... why not?
The things I'm most interested in are game development and software development. I joined Github mainly for code backups, but I grew more attracted to the idea of open source programming and helping others with the same ideas as me. I'm a hardstuck Java coder since 2013. I don't know when I'll finally come out of my comfort zone and try to learn something new, but I'm open to the idea.

## Notes
Programming with Java since I was 13, though I've rarely ever left my comfort zone.<br/>
Actively programming for the last year now (updated Jan 2nd 2021) in an attempt to ease out of this plateau.<br/>
Have the <img height="16" width="16" src="https://unpkg.com/simple-icons@v4/icons/linkedin.svg" /> LinkedIn Skill Assessment badge for Java.<br/>
Made [this abomination](https://www.elitepvpers.com/forum/need-speed-world/3792605-nfs-world-project-reborn.html) and promptly abandoned it when I exhausted my capabilities. Props to [this dude](https://youtu.be/qxuh3eAD4oo) for making a video on it at the time, visually cataloguing what my *attempt* was supposed to be.<br/>
