### [![KamotoIcon](https://cdn.discordapp.com/emojis/767970413384433676.png?v=1&size=16) **Kamoto**](https://gamejolt.com/games/Kamoto/401563)
**Kamoto** is an indie action roguelike with management elements. That's how I'd describe it, at least.

You're put in the shoes of Kamoto, who is a homeless 23 year old girl. She lives in the storage room of a laundromat establishment owned by Miroki, who charges her with rent as her landlord.
Kamoto is on the run, a person off the records. But, it has finally caught up to her.
She's been found by loan sharks, then tasked with collecting a sum of money in 30 days, but she happens to forget the exact amount she owes. Could you manage to collect the sum?

The game progresses with day-by-day gameplay. Ordinary pop-up events are the main way you'd gather contacts and earn small change. The big deal comes when you've struck an opportunity and the game switches to the turn-based action mode. You will directly be controlling Kamoto. You have the full freedom to choose how you'd want to handle a certain situation - loud, with your arsenal of weapons you've gathered - or quiet, trying to remain low and alert nobody.

### **Avoid the RED2** — *(unpublished and shelved)*
A revisit to an old Java game I made in 2013-2014. It's about falling blocks - tetris style - and you avoid the red ones. Some of the normal ones will turn red suddenly after they're close enough.
This "revisit" plans to add a multiplayer mode, leaderboards, challenges, and more.

### ...and more untitled projects
...which I am not going to talk about here, until I've done something with them (either cancelled, or started to work on).

### I'm interested in making more things. Soon(tm)
