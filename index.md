## Happy New Year!
<sup>Posted on 2nd Jan 2021</sup><br/>
First post of 2021! This is just a small post meant to wish everyone reading this a good, lucky and healthy new year. With a new year comes...! ...absolutely nothing new sans for a calendar date change. Though...
- This website has been updated.
- I've been much more active on my [Github](https://github.com/WolfNT90)
- Opened the [Outfoxed Interactive](https://github.com/Outfoxed-Interactive) organization.

but..
- My [Discord Server](about#accounts) is still **very** inactive.
- It's been awhile since I've made progress on [Kamoto](https://gamejolt.com/games/Kamoto/401563)
