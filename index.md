## Hey
I'm also known as Fennecsxx. I'm a very lazy kind of developer. Not too fond of uploading things I do, but I might as well do it from time to time.

### Here's a list of my works, in case you're wondering

# [Kamoto](https://gamejolt.com/games/Kamoto/401563)
Kamoto is a homeless 23 year old girl, who lives in the storage room of a laundromat establishment. Miroki, the owner of the establishment, charges her with minimal rent as her landlord. He knows her since the age of 19, when she walked in all bruised up. As of late, Kamoto was contacted by a group of loan sharks who, unable to find her parents, now threaten her safety. She is tasked with collecting a sum of money in 30 days, but she forgets the exact amount.
# Avoid the RED2 (unpublished)
A revisit to an old Java game I made in 2013-2014.
## ...and 3 more untitled projects!
...which I am not going to talk about here, until I've done something about them. (either cancelled, or started work on)

Thanks for reading.
